# How to Run a Node.js Server using the `node server.js` Command

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

## Getting Started

1. **Copy the source code**: Copy the server code (in this case, `server.js`) to your computer.

2. **Install dependencies (if needed)**: If your server uses other libraries or dependencies, you may need to install them before running the server. Use the following command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the server**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `server.js` file, then run the following command:

    ```
    node server.js
    ```

    The server will start running, and you'll receive notifications about connections to the server.

4. **Access the server**: By default, the server will run on port 3000. You can access the server through a web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **Stop the server**: To stop the server, simply press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Options

If your server uses a different port or has other configuration options, you may need to edit the `server.js` file before running it. Refer to the documentation or source code of your server for more detailed information.
